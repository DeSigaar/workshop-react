TODO: install dependecies & run server

## Task-1.0

To start the first task, you will need to uncomment a few lines of code within `src/App.js`. Find these by searching (CTRL/CMD + F) the keyword: `Task-1.0`.

### Task-1.1

Within the `src/components` folder go to the `level1` folder and open `Level1.js`. Uncomment the heading from this component to see the name being used from the input field in `src/App.js`. Change the name on the page and see what happens.

### Task-1.2

What is a list of movies without any movies in it? Let's create some Movie components! First, uncomment the `import Movie from "./Movie";` at the top of the file to import the Movie component. Now, let's fill the list. We set you up with an examle component within the `ul`. Uncomment it and edit the title value with your own movie title.

### Task-1.3

Now that you have a single Movie component, you should be able to create some more components to show of the movies that you have seen. Create at least 2 more Movie components to fill the list up to at least 3 seen movies.
